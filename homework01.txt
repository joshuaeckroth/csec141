Homework 1

due: Fri Sep 13, 11:59pm

Write a Python program on londo that asks the user for a website name (e.g., example.com), then asks the user for a filename containing a list of website paths (e.g., robots.txt). Your program should check every line from the file and see if the website has that file, indicated by HTTP code 200 (e.g., if example.com/robots.txt returns HTTP 200). For every website path that returns 200, print a message on the screen with the full path (e.g., example.com/robots.txt).

Call your program "dirb.py"

You can "turn in" your code by copying it to my directory on londo:
cp dirb.py /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/dirb-USERNAME.py  <<-- change the username to yours


Examples from class:

== httpcode.py ==

import requests

response = requests.get('https://webapi.teamviewer.com/api/v1/users', allow_redirects=False)
print(response.status_code)


== file.py ==

# be sure to make the file: nano myfile.txt

with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = line.strip()
        print(line)
