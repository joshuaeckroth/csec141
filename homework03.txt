Homework 3

due: Fri Sep 27, 11:59pm

Task 1: Run nmap on londo.stetson.edu. Activate the options for nmap that find
the versions of all running software and scan all ports (not just the 1000 that
nmap normally scans). You can run nmap directly on londo. Run "nmap --help" for
some information about nmap's options. Save the output to a text file and send
it to me. Do this by typing your nmap command followed by " | tee nmap.txt"
(without the quotes), which will send all the messages you see on the screen to
the file "nmap.txt". Then submit this file to me:

cp nmap.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/nmap-USERNAME.txt


Task 2: Search for subdomains on artifice.cc. You should find many of my course
websites among other things. Use subbrute on londo to do this:

/home/jeckroth/csec141/subbrute/subbrute.py --help

Read the help options to learn how to use the program. When you run the program
to search for subdomains, you'll need to add this to the command:

-r /home/jeckroth/csec141/subbrute/resolvers.txt

Also, save the output to a file by adding " | tee subbrute.txt" to the end of
the command line.

Submit your findings:

cp subbrute.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/subbrute-USERNAME.txt


Task 3: Run nikto on the website https://kronos.artifice.cc. Nikto searches for some
hidden web pages. Run it on londo like so:

/home/jeckroth/csec141/nikto/program/nikto.pl --help

Save the results to a file by adding " | tee nikto.txt" to the end of the
command. Submit your file:

cp nikto.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/nikto-USERNAME.txt


Task 4: Run dirb on the website https://localhost (i.e., scan londo itself).
Dirb searches for hidden web pages. Run on londo like so:

/home/jeckroth/csec141/dirb/dirb

You'll have to provide a word list to perform a scan. Use this wordlist:

/home/jeckroth/csec141/dirb/wordlists/small.txt

Save your output to a file with: " | tee dirb.txt" and submit:

cp dirb.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/dirb-USERNAME.txt


Task 5: Research how to perform advanced Google searches and write a Google
search that finds all Microsoft Excel files on Stetson's website(s).

Write the query in a file and submit to me:

cp google.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/google-USERNAME.txt
