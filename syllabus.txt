This course provides an overview of the broad range of issues, techniques,
people, organizations, and recent news related to cybersecurity. It
explains the ways in which cybersecurity impacts individuals,
organizations, and states and covers relevant US and international
laws. This course also exposes students to the various professions
connected with cybersecurity and provides the terms and concepts that
are revisited in all other CSEC courses. Students in this course use
a scripting language such as Python to simulate attacks and understand
cybersecurity principles.
