due: Fri Nov 22, 11:59pm

Using londo and gpg, complete the following tasks. Create a file, hw6.txt, with
all the commands that you run. Submit this file to me (see below).

Feel free to examine the files you will use below:

ls /home/jeckroth/csec141/gpg

You must also import my key before you can do anything else:

gpg --keyserver pgp.key-server.io --recv-key 850D41CD


1. Verify that I signed this file:
   /home/jeckroth/csec141/gpg/mobydick.txt.asc

2. Decrypt this file (replace USERNAME with your londo username):
   /home/jeckroth/csec141/gpg/USERNAME.encrypted.gpg

3. Verify my signature on this file and decrypt it (replace USERNAME):
   /home/jeckroth/csec141/gpg/USERNAME.signed.encrypted.gpg

4. Write a message in a text file and sign it.

5. Encrypt a message so only I can read it.

6. Encrypt a message so only I can read it and sign the message.


Submit your file of commands (replace USERNAME):

cp hw6.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/USERNAME-hw6.txt
