Homework 4

due: Fri Oct 11, 11:59pm

Copy my website code to your own directory:

cp -Rv /home/jeckroth/csec141/website-broken homework04
cd homework04

Fix the website app and templates so the following security features work correctly:

1. Passwords are longer and cannot be easily guessed, and are hidden when typed on the login form.
2. Usernames cannot be easily discovered (you'll need to think about how this is currently allowed).
3. Cookies work correctly to make sure you are logged in and you can only see your own private profile.
4. Cookie random number cannot be easily guessed.
5. Cookies disappear after a few days, not just when the browser closes (google how to do this).
6. Login uses POST not GET.
7. Logout works (you'll need to create this feature).

For submission, create a "tar archive":

tar cvfz homework04-USERNAME.tar.gz .

And then copy it to my folder:

cp homework04-USERNAME.tar.gz /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions
