Homework 5

due: Fri Nov 8, 11:59pm

Log in to delenn.stetson.edu (port 2222) with Putty/ssh. You'll have to use the VPN
if you're off-campus.

Copy the student-created hashes to your own directory:

cp /home/jeckroth/csec141/hashes/student-hashes.txt .

Run hashcat to crack the passwords. Read the documentation to get ideas of techniques:
https://hashcat.net/wiki/

Make sure you run hashcat with the output file option: -o cracked-passwords.txt

We have dictionaries on delenn in the directory: /bigdata/data/passwords. Feel free to
explore those and use them in your commands.

We have rules and masks in /usr/share/doc/hashcat. Feel free to explore those, too.

For full credit, you are required to crach XYZ% of them.

Submit your results file:

cp cracked-passwords.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/USERNAME-cracked-passwords.txt

^^^^^ CHANGE USERNAME to your own!
