Homework 2

due: Wed Sep 18, 11:59pm


Task 1: Write a Python program on londo that asks the user for an IP address
and a starting and ending port number. The program then scans the IP for open
ports in the range specified. Show all open ports that are found.

Call your program "portscan.py"

You can "turn in" your code by copying it to my directory on londo:
cp portscan.py /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/portscan-USERNAME.py


Task 2: Research the common ports used for the following services:

- Web sites, both secure (HTTPS) and non-secure (HTTP)
- SSH connections (like we do with Putty)
- DNS (domain name system)
- Secure email communications (both sending and looking at your inbox)
- Minecraft and other game servers
- Torrents
- Bitcoin
- Spotify

Call your file "ports.txt"

Turn in your file:
cp ports.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/ports-USERNAME.txt


Task 3: Find the IP address and registrar for the following domains:

- artifice.cc
- nytimes.com
- google.com
- guardian.co.uk
- stetson.edu

Call your file "domains.txt"

Turn in your file:
cp domains.txt /home/jeckroth/csec141/submissions/domains-USERNAME.txt
